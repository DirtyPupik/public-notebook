<title>Hardware vs. Software Breakpoints on Intel Hardware

</head><body><span style="font-size: 13pt">Hardware vs. Software Breakpoints on Intel Hardware<br/>
<br/>
Intel has separate concepts of a "hardware" breakpoint vs. a "software" breakpoint. It is generally possible to set an unlimited number of software breakpoints, because they take the form of a single byte "interrupt 3" (0xCC) instruction which the debugger writes into the instruction stream wherever it would like to break. When the interrupt occurs, it ultimately leads back to the debugger, which can update its metadata about what breakpoint fired where, rewrite the instruction stream so the original instruction can occur, update the UI for the human, and allow the execution to continue.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are a <b>limited number (4)</b>&nbsp;of dedicated Intel special purpose debug registers. These registers inform the memory management unit that it should watch for read, write, execute, or IO accesses targeted the specified addresses/IO ports. The watch instructions we previously saw are actually utilizing the hardware breakpoints behind the scenes. But we only saw read/write breakpoints. They also support break on execute. <b>The advantage of a hardware break on execute is that the memory targeted may not actually be mapped into the program's memory space yet.</b>&nbsp;But if you know the address it will be at later, once it is mapped in, then you can set a breakpoint for there and the processor will alert the debugger when the breakpoint is hit. This is most useful when dealing with malware which has intentional dynamism to the instructions it executes, or in the kernel where different physical memory can be mapped to the same virtual memory address at different times.<br/>
