</b>will show:<ul><li>PID: Unique process identifier</li>
<li>LWP (Light-Weight Process): Unique thread identifier inside a process</li>
<li>NLWP(Number of Light-Weight Processes): Number of threads for a given process</li>
</ul>
<br/>
NLWP is an indication to weather the process is single or multi threaded<br/>
Single-threaded processes have the same PID and LWP values as if they are the same thing. However, in a multi-threaded process, only one LWP matches its PID.<br/>
