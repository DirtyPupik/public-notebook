a folder mush be executable in order to touch its content, making a folder and changing group to r+w will not have any effect<br/>
<br/>
the <b>owner group</b>&nbsp;premission are affected by the rwx of the group<br/>
<br/>
<b>setuid</b>&nbsp;- the setuid/setguid permissions are used to tell the system to run an executable as the owner with the owner’s permissions.<br/>
in the example above, the file fd if owned by <b>fd_pwn</b>, and group owner is <b>fd</b>, in the group permission it has <b>x</b>, and in the owner permission <b>s,<br/>
</b>meaning, the user <b>fd</b>&nbsp;can execute the file <b>fd</b>&nbsp; as the owner (<b>fd_pwn)<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>It's possible for a file to be setuid but not executable; this is denoted by <b>capital S</b>, where the <b>capital S</b>&nbsp;alerts you that this setting is probably wrong because the setuid bit is (almost always) useless if the file is not executable.<br/>
