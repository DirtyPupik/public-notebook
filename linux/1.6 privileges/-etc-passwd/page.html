<br/>
6. <b>user's home dir</b><br/>
<br/>
7. <b>shell path - </b>the absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash).<br/>
Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.<br/>
For example, sysadmin can use the nologin shell, which acts as a replacement shell for the user accounts. If shell set to /sbin/nologin and the user tries to log in to the Linux system directly, the /sbin/nologin shell closes the connection.<br/>
