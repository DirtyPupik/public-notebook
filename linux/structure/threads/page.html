<title>Threads</title>
</head><body>A thread comprises of:<ul><li>Thread ID</li>
<li>Program counter</li>
<li>Register set</li>
<li>Stack</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Threads belonging to the same process share:<ul><li>Code section</li>
<li>Data section</li>
<li>Open files</li>
<li>Other OS resources </li>
</ul>
<br/>
Benefits of mulithreading:<ul><li><b>Responsiveness</b>- allow program to continue running even of part of it is blocked or delayed.</li>
<li><b>Resource Sharing </b>- the sharing allows an application to have different threads of activity within the same address space</li>
<li><b>Memory cost</b>- when resources are shared, memory is also shared and there's no need to reallocate memory to each thread being created. </li>
<li><b>Utilization of multiprocessor architectures</b>- threads may run in parallel on different processors. a single-threaded process can run only on one CPU.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The major downside is that since the threads share the same memory, they can become slow if the process does many concurrent tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Main two types of threads:<ul><li><b>User thread </b>- supported above the kernel and managed without kernel support.</li>
<li><b>Kernel thread</b>- supported and managed directly by the OS.</li>
</ul>
There must exist a relationship between the user and the kernel threads.<br/>
