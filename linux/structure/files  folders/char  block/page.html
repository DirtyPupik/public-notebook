</head><body>Char and block are considered special files (aka device files).<br/>
<ul><li>Special files provide an interface for devices in the form of a file in the file system.</li>
<li>They store content on the system</li>
<li>Read and write using special files happens immediately.</li>
<li>Char file acts as an interface to a char device - I/O happens one byte at a time (e.g. keyboard).</li>
<li>Block file atcs as an interface to a device which performs data I/O in units of blocks (e.g. physical storage device, ISO image file), size of blocks varies. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
To test for a char or block device, use <b>test</b>or <b>stat:</b><br/>
<br/>
test -b FILE<br/>
       FILE exists and is block special<br/>
test -c FILE<br/>
       FILE exists and is character special<br/>
<br/>
stat FILE</body></html>
