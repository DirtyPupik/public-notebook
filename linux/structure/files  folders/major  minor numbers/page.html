<ul><li><b>major number</b>- identifies the driver associated with the device.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>The kernel uses the major number at open time to dispatch execution to the appropriate driver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>minor number </b>- used only by the driver specified by the major number; </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>other parts of the kernel donâ€™t use it. </li>
<li>It is common for a driver to control several devices.</li>
<li>the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
