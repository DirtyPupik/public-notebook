Answer is false<br/>
C has affinity for unsinged over signed.<br/>
There is a comparison between <b>unsigned long</b>&nbsp;and <b>signed int</b>.<br/>
Because the first is unsigned, the second is treated as unsigned also, -1=FFFF'FFFF, biggest unsigned number.<br/>
<br/>

Answer is false.<br/>
float is 6 deg of perssesion, while double is 10 deg.<br/>
C has an affinity for double, the 0.1 in the if statement is treated as double as instead of float.<br/>
The end comparision is 0.100000 ==? 0.1000000000, which ends up false.<br/>

Answer is "Segmentation fault".<br/>
The SIGSEGV (segmentation violation), occures due to unallowed memory access.<br/>
The pointer p is assigned to the memory address 0x0.<br/>
Trying to write 'A' at memory location 0x0, will cause SIGSEGV.<br/>

The answer is '' (nothing).<br/>
The really bad indentation is confusing..<br/>
<br/>
The "else" is part of the nested 'if' statement.<br/>
The nested never gets executed due to the fact the 'a' is not bigger than 'b'.<br/>
For the parent 'if' there is no 'else'.<br/>
