<title>#define vs const</title>
</head><body>#define is a preprocessor directive. Data defined by the #define macro definition are preprocessed, so that your entire code can use it. This can free up space and increase compilation times.<br/>
<br/>
const variables are considered variables, and not macro definitions. <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Long story short: CONSTs are handled by the compiler, where as #DEFINEs are handled by the pre-processor.<br/>
<br/>
The big advantage of const over #define is type checking. #defines can’t be type checked, so this can cause problems when trying to determine the data type. If the variable is, instead, a constant then we can grab the type of the data that is stored in that constant variable. <br/>
<br/>
Since const are considered variables, we can use pointers on them. This means we can typecast, move addresses, and everything else you’d be able to do with a regular variable besides change the data itself, since the data assigned to that variable is constant.</body></html>
