<title>labels &amp; goto</title>
</head><body>GCC allows you to declare local labels in any nested block scope. A local label is just like an ordinary label, but you can only reference it (with a goto statement, or by taking its address) within the block in which it is declared.<br/>
<br/>
A local label declaration looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
<b>__label__ label;</b><br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
<b>__label__ label1, label2, /* â€¦ */;<br/>
</b><br/>
Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the block, before any ordinary declarations or statements.<br/>
<br/>
The label declaration defines the label name, but does not define the label itself. You must do this in the usual way, with label:, within the statements of the statement expression.<br/>
