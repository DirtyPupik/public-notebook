</head><body>&nbsp;The program counter is accessed as r15 (or pc). It is incremented by one word (four bytes - 32) for each instruction in ARM state, or by two bytes (16) in Thumb state. &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;Branch instructions load the destination address into the program counter. &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;The address of the currently executing instruction is typically pc–8 for ARM, or pc–4 for Thumb. <br/>
<br/>
this means -<br/>
<b><span style="font-size: 15pt">The actual PC value is always the address of the current instruction + 8 in ARM mode and +4 in Thumb</span></b><br/>
