</head><body>ARM syntax is generally UAL (Unified Assembler Language), other syntax's used<br/>
<br/>
all processors mainly deal with 32-bit addressing range<br/>
<br/>
ARM architecture versions v4T and above define a 16-bit instruction set called the<br/>
Thumb instruction set. The functionality of the Thumb instruction set is a subset of the<br/>
functionality of the 32-bit ARM instruction set. <br/>
 <br/>
A processor that is executing Thumb instructions is operating in Thumb state. A<br/>
processor that is executing ARM instructions is operating in ARM state <br/>
<br/>
A processor in ARM state cannot execute Thumb instructions, and a processor in<br/>
Thumb state cannot execute ARM instructions. <br/>
 <br/>
Each instruction set includes instructions to change processor state <br/>
 <br/>
ARM processors always start executing code in ARM state. <br/>
