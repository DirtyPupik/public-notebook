<title>Registers</title>
</head><body>x86-64 has 16 general purpose registers, 64 bits wide<br/>
x86-32 has 8 gps and 32 bit wide<br/>
out of these registers, one is for IP, one for flag and the rest are &quot;segment&quot;<br/>
<br/>
there are 2 naming conventions for the registers, one by intel and one by amd<br/>
intel marks alphabetical names with meaning<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The 8 GPRs are as follows by intel's naming convention:<br/>
(note. this convention is optional, gpr's can be used differently)<br/>
<ul><li>Accumulator register (<b>AX</b>). Used in arithmetic operations</li>
<li>Counter register (<b>CX</b>). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops and strings.</li>
<li>Data register (<b>DX</b>). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.</li>
<li>Base register (<b>BX</b>). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).</li>
<li>Stack Pointer register (<b>SP</b>). Pointer to the top of the stack.</li>
<li>Stack Base Pointer register (<b>BP</b>). Used to point to the base of the stack.</li>
<li>Source Index register (<b>SI)</b>. Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.</li>
<li>Destination Index register (<b>DI</b>). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.</li>
<li>Instruction pointer (<b>IP</b>). pointer to next instruction to execute</li>
</ul>
