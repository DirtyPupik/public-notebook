<title>Canonical address</title>
</head><body>A canonical address must have its most significant bits (MSBs) either all set to 1 or all set to 0.<br/>
The number of MSB's is dependent on the platform (see MAXPHYADDR).<br/>
<br/>
From the manual<br/>
"<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 15pt"><span style="font-family: -apple-system">In 64-bit mode, an address is considered to be in canonical form if address bits 63 through to the most-significant implemented bit by the microarchitecture are set to either all ones or all zeros.</span></span></div>"<br/>
