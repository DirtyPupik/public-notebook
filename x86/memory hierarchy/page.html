</b><br/>
<b>Processor registers</b>&nbsp;– the fastest possible access (usually 1 CPU cycle). A few thousand bytes in size.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Cache</b><br/>
Level 0 (L0) Micro operations cache – 6,144 bytes in size<br/>
Level 1 (L1) Instruction cache – 128 KiB in size<br/>
Level 1 (L1) Data cache – 128 KiB in size. Best access speed is around 700 GB/s<br/>
Level 2 (L2) Instruction and data (shared) – 1 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 200 GB/s<br/>
Level 3 (L3) Shared cache – 6 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 100 GB/s<br/>
Level 4 (L4) Shared cache – 128 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 40 GB/s<br/>

<b>Disk storage </b>(Secondary storage) – Terabytes in size. As of 2017, best access speed is from a consumer solid state drive is about 2000 MB/s</body></html>
