<title>The Stack</title>
</head><body>typically, the stack grows from high to low address, towards the heap<br/>
<br/>
<b>top of the stack</b>&nbsp;- the lowest address which is being used (thats where the RSP register points)<br/>
while data will exist at addresses beyond the top of the stack, it is considerd undefined<br/>
<br/>
what can i find on the stack?<ul><li><b>return addresses - </b>so a called function can return to the function that called it</li>
<li><b>local variables</b></li>
<li>sometimes used to pass arguments between functions</li>
<li>save space for registers between different functions</li>
<li>save space for registers for same function (when takes too many resources)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>alloca() - </b>dynamically alocated memory on the stack<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
main() is the first called, it calls foo() which calls bar()<br/>
