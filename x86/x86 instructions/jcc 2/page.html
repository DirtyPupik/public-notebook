<ul><li>When using signed or unsigend notation, the compiler emits different instructions, this helps to understand the code written by the programmer and reverse engineer it.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>From the Hardware prespective, it doesn't matter if the integer was signed or unsigned, the arithmithic operation will be done the in same manner</li>

&quot;<span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><div style="text-align: left">The hardware keeps various status flags in RFLAGs. Some are relevant to operations on signed numbers, some are relevant to ops on unsigned numbers. Some (e.g. like the zero flag) don't care whether it's signed or unsigned. The hardware sets all flags, based on internal logic which accounts for whether the values could have been signed or could have been unsigned. The compiler is what ultimately is responsible for emitting the correct assembly instructions which behind the scenes check the right bits to honor the behavior as if something had been been signed or unsigned.&quot;</div></span></span> <br/>
