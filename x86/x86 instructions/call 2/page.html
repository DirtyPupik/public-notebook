</head><body>CALL's job is to transfer control to a different function, in a way that the control can be later resumed where it was left off.<br/>
<br/>
first it pushes the address of the <b>next</b>&nbsp;instruction onto the stack (to be used by RET when procedure is done)<br/>
(PUSH RSP-8h, RIP)<br/>
<br/>
than is changes RIP (instruction poiner) to the address given in the instructions<br/>
<br/>
the destination address for the target function (the function being called) can be specified in multiple ways:<ul><li>absolute address</li>
<li>relative address (relative to the end of instruction or some other register</li>
</ul>
