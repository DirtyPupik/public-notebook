<br/>
<span style="font-family: Open Sans"><span style="font-size: 16pt"><div style="text-align: left">Â <b>dt -b (nt!_KTSS64) TSS_address</b>&nbsp;- interpret the memory at that address as a Microsoft _KTSS64 structure type</div></span></span>&nbsp; <br/>

<ul><li>Tasks were a hardware mechanism to support multi-tasking, by saving/restoring task state (e.g. registers).</li>
<li>Tasks are not in use in x86-64 anymore.</li>
<li>Task State Segment (TSS) is still (and MUST be) in use by the OS. it is consulted when task switching occure due to interrupt.</li>
</ul>

TR stores number of byte from base of GDT to the TSS.<br/>
in the below image, GDTR ends in 0xafb0, GDTL is 0x57, that gives 0xafb0+0x57 = 0xb007.<br/>
each record in GDT is 8 byte, 0x57/0x8 = A (10 decimal), meaning there are 10 records with indices 0 to 9.<br/>
the last record ends at 0xb007.<br/>
in the example below TR stores 0x40, devided by 8 byte gives the <b>8th</b>&nbsp;record, as shown.<br/>
<b><span style="font-size: 15pt">***importent - TR is a segment selector, first 3 bits are RPL and TI, in order to correctly point at the index, right shift by 3 must be preformed and not devide, TR acctually stores record number and not number of bytes from base of GDT, it is just left shifed by 3.</span></b><br/>

In 64 bit there is no <b>Task Gate.</b><br/>

TR points at TSSD in GDT, then the hidden catch is filled, and the TR will point to the TSS.<br/>

<ul><li>The stack address where the temporary task switch info is stored is in a kernel address, where one cannot temper.</li>
<li>IST - &nbsp;Interrupt Stack Table.</li>
<li>Back in 32 and 16 bit, the TSS was used as its name implies, now in 64 bit, it merely points to a protected stack location.</li>
</ul>

One can find TSS records in GDT in windbg.<br/>
Base address can be conjugated with given info.<br/>

After address is found, one can examine the TSS structure. notice the address.<br/>
