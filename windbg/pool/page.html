<br/>
The Windows kernel has multiple &quot;pools&quot;, which are really just heaps from which memory can be allocated. Pools can have different &quot;tags&quot;, to help developers identify which allocations came from their own code (if they specified a custom tag at allocation time), or when the data is from a pool of all the same type of data structures.<br/>
