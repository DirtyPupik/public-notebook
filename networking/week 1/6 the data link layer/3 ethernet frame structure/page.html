<title>3 Ethernet frame structure</title>
</head><body><b>Ethernet frame - </b>a highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order<br/>

<br/>
<b>Preamble</b>is 8 bytes or 64 bits long and can itself be split into two sections.<br/>
The first seven bytes are a series of alternating ones and zeros.<br/>
These act partially as a buffer between frames and can also be used by the network interfaces to synchronize internal clocks they use, to regulate the speed at which they send data.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SFD (</b>last byte in the preamble<b>)</b>or start frame delimiter. This signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow.<br/>
