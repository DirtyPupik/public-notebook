<title>1 Ethernet and MAC address</title>
</head><body><b>in the data link layer, communication on the LAN is conducted via the physical MAC address of devices.<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Ethernet protocol -</b>the most common protocol to send data between individual links<b><br/>
</b>the purpose is to abstract the lower layer, so that the higher layer will receive its data without caring if connection is via wifi or cable<br/>
Ethernet, as a protocol, solved the <b>collision domain </b>problem by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (<b>CSMA/CD)<br/>
</b><b>CSMA/CD</b>is used to determine when the communications channels are clear and when the device is free to transmit data.<br/>
<br/>
<b>MAC Address</b>- a globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface. It's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers. this gives 2^48 possible combinations<br/>
The first three octets of a MAC address are known as the organizationally unique identifier or <b>OUI</b>. this gives 16.7 milion companies and 16.7 milion devices for each one<br/>
<br/>
<b>DATA PACKETS AT THE ETHERNET LEVEL ARE KNOWN AS ETHERNET FRAMES<br/>
