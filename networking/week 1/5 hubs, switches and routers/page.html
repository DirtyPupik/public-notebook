<title>5 Hubs, switches and routers</title>
</head><body><b>Hubs and Switches - connects devices in a single network (LAN)<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>hubs - layer 1 device - </b>all devices talk to each other - broadcast all day long. this creates collison domain<br/>
<br/>
<b>collision domain</b>, is a network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.<br/>
<br/>
<b>switch - layer 2 device - </b>connects only 2 computers in communication (no broadcast ADL)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Router - layer 3 device - </b>connects individual nodes<br/>
Routers share data with each other via a protocol known as BGP, or border gateway protocol, that let's them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
all of the above are considered to be <b>NODES<br/>
