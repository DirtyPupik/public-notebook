<title>6 Hosts files</title>
</head><body>ancient tech, still in use today, contains lines of ip and host name eg:<b><br/>
</b><b>1.2.3.4 webserver<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Loopback address -</b>&nbsp;a way of sending trafic to yourself, it has IPv4 address of 127.0.0.1 <br/>
<br/>
Almost every hosts file in existence will in the very least, contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost. Most likely followed by ::1 localhost where ::1 is the loop back address for IPv 6.<br/>
<br/>
hosts files are mostly replaced by DNS<br/>
hosts files are examined before DNS resolutions - prone to vulenrbilities</body></html>
