<title>1 DHCP</title>
</head><body>DHCP is application layer but its purpose is to help configure the network layer<br/>
<br/>
DHCP listens on UDP port 67<br/>
<br/>
each computer on a TCP/IP network needs to have 4 things configured:<br/>
subnet mask<br/>
default gateway<br/>
name server<br/>
ip address<br/>
<br/>
the first 3 are the same for every node on a network<br/>
but IP needs to be different for every single node<br/>
<br/>
here comes DHCP to the rescue<br/>
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol<br/>
DHCP is an application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network.<br/>
<br/>
<b>dynamic allocation</b>- a range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one.<br/>
Under a dynamic allocation the IP of a computer could be different almost every time it connects to the network<br/>
<br/>
<b>automatic allocation </b>- a range of IPs is set aside for assignment purpose<br/>
<br/>
<b>fixed allocation - </b>requires manually input of MAC address to IP<br/>
its a sequrity measure to ensure communication to only certian devices<br/>
as such, see MAC spoofing<br/>
<br/>
DHCP can also be used to assign NTP servers<br/>
<b>NTP server </b>- network time protocol - used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time<br/>
