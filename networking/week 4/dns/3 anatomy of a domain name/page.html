<title>3 Anatomy of a Domain Name</title>
</head><body>every domain has 3 parts<br/>
www . google . com<br/>
<br/>
<b>com</b>is the TLD top level domain - (com, net, edu, ac, org..)<br/>
<br/>
Due to the growth of the Internet, many of the TLDs originally defined have become very crowded. So today, a number of vanity TLDs are available, everything from .museum to .pizza<br/>
<br/>
Administration and definition of TLDs is handled by ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers<br/>
its a sister org to IANA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>google</b>is the domain<br/>
Domains are used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD name server, to an authoritative name server.<br/>
domains can be chosen and register<br/>
<br/>
<b>www </b>is the sub-domain<br/>
sometimes referred to as a host name if it's been assigned to only one host.<br/>
<br/>
when all the above are combined we get a Fully qualified domain name FQDN<br/>
<br/>
A registrar is a company that has an agreement with ICANN to sell unregistered domain names.<br/>
<br/>
Technically you can have lots of subdomain names, for example host.sub.sub.subdomain.domain.com can be completely valid. Although you rarely see fully qualified domain names with that many levels. DNS can technically support up to 127 levels of domain in total for a single fully qualified domain name.<br/>
There are some other restrictions in place for how your domain name can be specified. Each individual section can only be 63 characters long and a complete FQDN is limited to a total of 255 characters</body></html>
