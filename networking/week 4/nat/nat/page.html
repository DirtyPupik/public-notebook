</head><body>Network Address Translation<br/>
Unlike protocols like DNS and DHCP, network address translation or NAT, is a technique instead of a defined standard.<br/>
NAT takes one IP and translates it to another, it has few ways to do that, the most common is PAT (port address translation, aka NAT overload)<br/>
the NAT changes the private IP of a device on a network to a public global IP of the router (supplied by the ISP), the router keeps the port number<br/>
<b>Port preservation</b>&nbsp;is a technique where the source port chosen by a client, is the same port used by the router.<br/>
through the port number, the router will know to which device and what app the response should be returned<br/>
the router builds a NAT table:<br/>

the port chosen by a device is ephemeral port (49152â€“65535), <b>collision is possible</b><br/>
<br/>
port forwarding - 1 to 1 port address translation, its kinda like a fixed port per device<br/>
