<title>Proxy</title>
</head><body>a server that "acts on behalf"<br/>
can be front proxy to serve the client<br/>
or reverse proxy to serve a server<br/>
<br/>
proxy can provide: anonymity, security, content filtering, increased prefomance and more<br/>
a gateway router meets the definition of a proxy<br/>
proxies exist in every layer, and vary in type<br/>
<br/>
<b>web proxy - </b>back than one of the uses was to catch conten, but nowdays connection is fast enough for this to be redundent, also web has become very dynamic<br/>
web proxy can act as a firewall and forbid access to some sites (lets say no twitter on school network)<br/>
<br/>
<b>reverse proxy - </b>appear as single server to many clients but represents many servers behind it, it can distribute request, similar to the DNS round robin load balancing<br/>
<br/>
proxies also help encryption (?)<br/>
