multiplexing - take data from serval sources and deliver it to one place<br/>
demultiplexing - taking data from one place and delivering it to serval different places<br/>
<br/>
the transport layer handles the de/multiplexing through <b>PORT</b>s<br/>
<br/>
<b>PORT</b>is a 16-bit number that's used to direct traffic to specific services running on a networked computer.<br/>
Different network services run while listening on specific ports for incoming requests.<br/>
