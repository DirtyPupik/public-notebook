<title>4 TCP Socket states</title>
</head><body><b>LISTEN</b>- Listen means that a TCP socket is ready and listening for incoming connections.You'd see this on the server side only.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SYN_SENT</b>- This means that a synchronization request has been sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet. You'd see this on the client side only.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SYN_RECEIVED</b>- This means that a socket previously in a listener state, has received a synchronization request and sent a SYN_ACK back. But it hasn't received the final ACK from the client yet. You'd see this on the server side only.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
all the next states can exist for both sides:<br/>
<br/>
<b>ESTABLISHED</b>- This means that the TCP connection is in working order, and both sides are free to send each other data.<br/>
<br/>
<b>FIN_WAIT</b>- This means that a FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other end hasn't been received yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>CLOSE_WAIT</b>- This means that the connection has been closed at the TCP layer, but that the application that opened the socket hasn't released its hold on the socket yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>CLOSED</b>- This means that the connection has been fully terminated, and that no further communication is possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
socket states and their names, can vary from operating system to operating system. That's because they exist outside of the scope of the definition of TCP itself.</body></html>
