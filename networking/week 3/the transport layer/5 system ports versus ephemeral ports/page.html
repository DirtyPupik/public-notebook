<title>5 System Ports versus Ephemeral Ports</title>
</head><body><b>Three categories of ports</b><br/>
Since a 16-bit number identifies ports, there can be 65,535 of them. Given the number of ports available, they have been divided into three categories by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA): System Ports, User Ports, and Ephemeral Ports.<br/>
<br/>
<b>System Ports</b>are identified as ports 1 through 1023. System ports are reserved for common applications like FTP (port 21) and Telnet over TLS/SSL (port 992). Many still are not assigned. Note: Modern operating systems do not use system ports for outbound traffic.<br/>
<br/>
<b>User Ports</b>are identified as ports 1024 through 49151. Vendors register user ports for their specific server applications. The IANA has officially registered some but not all of them.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Ephemeral Ports (Ephemeral = lasting for a very short time)</b>(Dynamic or Private Ports) are identified as ports 49152 through 65535. Ephemeral ports are used as temporary ports for private transfers. Only clients use ephemeral ports.</body></html>
