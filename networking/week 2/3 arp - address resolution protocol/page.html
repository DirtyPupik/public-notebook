<title>3 ARP - Address Resolution Protocol</title>
</head><body>ARP the relating protocol between the data link layer and the network layer<br/>
<br/>
ARP is a protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all network connected devices will retain a local ARP table. An ARP table is just a list of IP addresses an the Mac addresses associated with them.<br/>
(the values of IP to MAC are assigned by DHCP)<br/>
<br/>
if there is no data of an IP in the ARP table, the sending device sends a <b>broadcast ARP msg </b>over the broadcast address (255.255.255.255 or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)<br/>
<br/>
the recieving end sends back an <b>ARP response</b>containing the MAC address assosiated<br/>
<br/>
the MAC\IP pair will be stored in a local ARP table with short expiry time<br/>
