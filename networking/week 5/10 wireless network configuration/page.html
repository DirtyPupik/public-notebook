<title>10 Wireless network configuration</title>
</head><body>3 main ways for wireless network to be configured:<br/>
<br/>
<b>1. Ad-hoc networks</b><br/>
in an ad-hoc network, there isn't really any supporting network infrastructure. Every device involved with the network communicates with every other device within range and all nodes help pass along messages.<br/>

its not the most common configuration. its good for disaster situations, because theres no need for an infrastructure<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. wireless lan (WLAN)</b><br/>
the most common type, consists of one or more access poits that bridge between the wired and wireless networks<br/>

<br/>
<b>3.mesh networks</b><br/>
Consists mostly of wireless networks. This kind of network let's you deploy more access points to the mesh without having to run a cable to each of them.<br/>
