<title>7 IEEE 802.11</title>
</head><body>the 802.11 protocol operates at data link and physical layers<br/>
<br/>
a set of common specification standard for the wireless communication network<br/>
there are different 802.11 standards that use the same protocol but might operate at different frequency band<br/>
(FM radio bands are 88 to 108 MHz)<br/>
WiFi network bands work on 2.4 and 5 GHz<br/>
<br/>
the most common specs of 802.11x are: (x=...) <b>b, a, g, n, ac </b>(versions are listed by order of adoption) <br/>
newer versions allow higher speeds and more devices<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the frame:<br/>
*<b>Wireless access point</b>- a device that bridges the wireless and wired portions of a network<br/>

<b><br/>
</b><b>Frame control -</b>16bits, contains a number of subfields describing how the frame should be processed, include things like protocol version<br/>
<b>Duration / ID - </b>specifies how long the total frame is. So, the receiver knows how long it should expect to have to listen to the transmission<br/>
<br/>
because of the use of multiple wireless access points there is a need for 4 address:<br/>
<b>source address - </b>MAC ad of the client device<br/>
<b>intended destination</b>on (inside) the network<br/>
<b>Receiving address - </b>MAC address of the access point that is supposed to receive the frame<br/>
<b>Transmitter address - </b>MAC ad of the access point that have just transmitted the frame<br/>
<br/>
most of the times the destination and receiving are the same and, the source and transmitter are also the same<br/>
<br/>
<b>sequence control field - </b>16bits to keep track of ordering of the frames<br/>
<br/>
<b>FCS - </b>contains a checksum<br/>
