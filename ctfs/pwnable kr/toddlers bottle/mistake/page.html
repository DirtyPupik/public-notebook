<title>mistake</title>
</head><body>the mistake happens at the begining:<br/>
<br/>
<b>int fd;<br/>
if (fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) &lt; 0) { <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printf("can't open password %d\n", fd); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
</b><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return 0;</b><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><b>}</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
since "&lt;" has higher priority than "=", the right part is evaluated first<br/>
the right part of the expression -&#09;<b>open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) &lt; 0</b>&#09;- will be equal to 0,<br/>
since open(2) returns an FD (usally something like 63), and (63&lt;0)=false=0 .<br/>
so it comes to be: &nbsp; <b>if (fd = 0) {exit}; else {proceed}<br/>
</b>this statement evaluates to false, so the program will proceed and the file descriptor fd will be assigned with the value of zero (fd=0 (stdin))<br/>
<br/>
later on at the code, the password is read from the (<b>wrong</b>) file descriptor - stdin<br/>
so the user is the one who's declaring the password<br/>
<br/>
all what left to do is give a 10 char password such as CCCCCCCCCC<br/>
and another one such as BBBBBBBBBB (see the mistake.c file on the linux machine and vscode for full description)</body></html>
