</b>the file seems to be a buffer overflow exploit, it displays a messege and takes input.<b><br/>
</b><b><img height="53" src="image 3.png" width="350"/><br/>
</b>we are able to overwrite the IP and seems there are no canaries<br/>

</b><br/>
disassembling and further examin:<br/>
there are no precautions at all, making it simpler<br/>
<img height="89" src="image 5.png" width="300"/><br/>
<br/>
at the symbol table we see <b>_start</b>enrty point, and <b>_exit</b><br/>
(there's no main() function, _start is main() caller, its an early low-level initialization, <a href="https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2019/04/08/a-general-overview-of-what-happens-before-main/#:~:text=happens%20before%20main%20.-,The%20_start%20Function,is%20merely%20a%20general%20convention.">futrther read</a>)<br/>
<img height="40" src="image 7.png" width="450"/><br/>
<br/>
in the disassembly we see:<br/>
<img height="399" src="image 6.png" width="350"/><br/>
(+0) esp address is pushed onto the stack (we'll get back to it)<br/>
(+1) a return address to _exit is pushed onto the stack<br/>
(+6 to +34) register zeroing and pushing a string (little endian representation of &quot;Lets start the CTF:&quot;)<br/>
(+32) pointer to the string is pushed to ecx<br/>
further, there are are some register value setting and 2 <b>int 0x80<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>the <b>int 0x80</b>is interrupt call to 0x80 interrupt number, which handler is the kernel, to invoke a system call, it takes the value in eax as the program to run and values in the other registers as parameters by order, eg B, C, D... (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817577/what-does-int-0x80-mean-in-assembly-code">futher read</a>)<br/>
<b><br/>
</b><b>/usr/include/asm/unistd_32.h</b>			path to syscall argument number table<br/>
(with &lt;<b>gcc -m32</b>&gt; the m32 defines __i386, so <b>/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</b>includes &lt;<b>asm/unistd_32.h</b>&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
so the first interrupt (eax = 4) is <b>write(int fd, *buffer, size )</b>, ebx being the file descriptor stdout, ecx is the pointer to the buffer (&lt;+39&gt; the address of esp is pushed to ecx), and edx is being the size of 0x14 - 20 bytes long.<br/>
this interrupt will read 20 bytes of the address pointed by ecx to stdout (Lets start the CTF:)<br/>
<br/>
second interrupt is for <b>read(int fd, *bufer, size)</b>, taking user input from stdin and writing it to the stack.<br/>
<br/>
afterwards (&lt;+57&gt;) the program returns to _exit and quits the program with interrupt to exit()<br/>
<img height="87" src="image 8.png" width="350"/><br/>
<br/>
so summing it up, program starts, takes an input and writes it to the stack, than exits.<br/>
seeing that we may overwrite esp, we can try and alter execution order.<br/>
<br/>
trying to overflow the program, we see that we have control over esp at an offset of 20 bytes<br/>
also we see the original SP that was pushed onto the at &lt;+0&gt;<br/>
<img height="371" src="image 9.png" width="1000"/><br/>
(*ASLR disabled)<br/>
<br/>
as we have an SP address on the stack, we may try and insert a shellcode onto the stack, return orient to that address and execute that code.<br/>
but first we need to leak that ESP.<br/>
<br/>
looking at the disassembly again we see that if we redirect to _start +39, where the next ESP value the stack address pushed at &lt;+0&gt;.<br/>
this address is can be leaked by printing it to stdout.<br/>
<img height="204" src="image 10.png" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
so our first payload is in order to leak a stack address is:<br/>
(b&quot;A&quot;*20 + b&quot;\x87\x80\x04\x08&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
after redirecting, we capture the leaked stack address, and get ready to send another payload.<br/>
this time, the payload will contain 20 bytes of spacing as before, the leaked SP + 20 bytes and our shellcode.<br/>
(its SP+20 casue of <b>add 0x14,</b>at 20 byte offset is where we will place our shellcode)<br/>
<br/>
the shellcode i will insert will invoke a syscall to execve to spawn an sh shell.<br/>
<br/>
so now that we know the route of our solution. we may write a script for the exploit and run it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 11.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
running the exploit, we get a shell<br/>
